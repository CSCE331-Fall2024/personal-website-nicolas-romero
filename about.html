                        I am Nico - an aspiring software engineer that loves creating 
                        functional and beautiful products.

                        In my free time I enjoy bouldering and climbing top-rope. I also
                        love trying new cuisines, so you’ll find me trying new restaurants 
                        frequently.

                    <p>
                        I also love to travel and experience new places and cultures. I have 
                        been fortunate enough to have visited Canada, Mexico, England, Spain, 
                        France, The Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Oman, the United Arab Emirates, 
                        India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Japan. I was lucky enough to have spent 
                        8 years living in Doha, Qatar during my childhood.

                    I am currently a student at Texas A&M University studying Computer Engineering.
                    I am expected to graduate in May 2026, and I am currently looking for internships
                    relating to software engineering and web development. I am looking for opportunities
                    that will allow me to learn and improve my skills in a professional setting, and would
                    like to have industry specific experience before I graduate. I want to learn and work
                    with professional development cycles like Agile and Scrum, and practice developing with a 
                    team of developers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my free time as well as when I am doing work, I enjoy listening to music. I have currently
                    been listening to a lot of Frank Ocean, Mk.gee, and Deftones. Channel Orange and Blonde are two
                    of my favorite albums, and I always find myself going back to them. I have also been loving 
                    Mk.gee’s latest album, Two Star & The Dream Police. I love the production of the album, and the
                    ethereal and dreamy sound. When I work out and rock climb I enjoy listening to Deftones, as their
                    music is heavy and loud. My favorite songs to listen to while I am working out are Change, Digital Bath,
                    Be Quiet and Drive, and Rosemary. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also a huge fan of TV and Cinema. My favorite TV shows include Severance, Modern Family, and Shogun.
                    Some of my favorite movies include Roberto Benigni’s <a class="bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CTjcVr9Iao&ab_channel=Miramax">Life is Beautiful</a>, 
                    Christopher Nolan's <a class="bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LqzF5WauAw&ab_channel=InterstellarMovie">Interstellar</a>,
                    and Katsuhiro Otomo’s <a class="bold" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA8KmHC2Z-g&ab_channel=RetroBiografen">Akira</a>. 
                    Movies and TV shows are an amazing way to unwinds and relax, and I personally love to watching some after a long day.
